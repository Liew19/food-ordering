  print("3) Advantages of Priority algorithm:");
  print("   - Achieves the best balance between efficiency and fairness");
  print("   - Solves the starvation problem of SJF, no orders are indefinitely postponed");
  print("   - Provides shorter average waiting times than FCFS");
  print("   - Dynamically adapts to different order situations, providing better overall experience");
  print("   - Can be adjusted according to business requirements, offering greater flexibility");
